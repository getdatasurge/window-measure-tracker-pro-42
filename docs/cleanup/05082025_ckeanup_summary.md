# Window Tracker Application Cleanup Summary - May 8, 2025

## Overview

This document outlines the cleanup and refactoring recommendations for converting the Window Tracker application into a public, read-only version with no authentication requirements. The goal is to remove all authentication logic, external dependencies, and prepare the codebase for a potential framework switch.

## 1. Authentication Removal

### Files to Delete:
- `/src/contexts/auth/` (except for the modified `AuthProvider.tsx` which now provides a public user context)
- `/src/components/auth/`
- `/src/features/auth/`
- `/src/hooks/useLogout.ts`
- `/src/components/modals/LoginModal.tsx`
- `/src/components/modals/SignupModal.tsx`
- `/src/stores/useAuthModalStore.ts` (if not referenced elsewhere)
- `/supabase/functions/backfill-profiles/` (authentication-related)

### Code Modifications:
- Removed authentication checks and conditionals in components
- Modified `AuthProvider.tsx` to provide a public user context
- Simplified hooks like `useFormSubmission.ts` and `useMeasurementUpdate.ts` to work without auth

## 2. External Dependencies & Routing

### External References to Remove:
- Any URLs pointing to external domains in navigation links
- External API calls not required for public read-only functionality
- Embedded content from external sources

### Routing Simplification:
- Removed authentication-protected routes
- Eliminated redirects to login/signup pages
- Simplified navigation to focus on core public features

## 3. Unused Packages & Dependencies

### Packages to Consider Removing:
- `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs`
- `@supabase/auth-helpers-react`
- Any authentication libraries (Clerk, Auth0, etc.)
- Unused UI component libraries
- Redundant utility packages

## 4. Folder Structure Audit

### Current Structure Issues:
- Deep nesting in `/src/components/` makes navigation difficult
- Feature code is scattered across multiple directories
- Inconsistent organization patterns (sometimes by feature, sometimes by type)
- Duplicated functionality in different folders

### Proposed Structure:
```
src/
├── app/                        # App shell and global providers
│   ├── App.tsx                # Top-level app layout
│   └── RootProvider.tsx       # All context/state combined
│
├── assets/                    # Static assets (icons, images, etc.)
│   └── icons/
│   └── images/
│
├── components/                # Global shared UI components
│   ├── ui/                    # Buttons, inputs, dropdowns

│   ├── data/                  # Data presentation: tables, charts
│   └── shared/                # Other reusable UI units
│
├── constants/                 # App-wide constants and enums
│   ├── routes.ts              # Central route mapping
│   └── app.ts                 # Static config (appName, roles)

│   │   ├── hooks.ts

│   │   └── components/
│   ├── teams/
│   ├── reports/
│   └── measurements/
│

│   ├── index.tsx              # Landing page
│   ├── dashboard/
│   ├── usersettings/
│   └── offline/               # Offline fallback screens
│
├── hooks/                     # Generic reusable logic hooks
│   ├── useSyncQueue.ts        # Add to sync queue
│   ├── useOfflineCache.ts     # Read/write to local store
│   └── useOnlineStatus.ts     # Detect offline/online state
│
├── services/                  # Cross-feature logic
│   ├── cache/                 # IndexedDB or localForage logic
│   │   └── offlineStore.ts
│   ├── sync/                  # Conflict resolution & sync batching
│   │   └── syncQueue.ts
│   ├── network/               # Fetching & online detection
│   └── db/                    # Normalized data handling
```

### Renaming Recommendations:
- Make file names more descriptive of their purpose
- Use consistent naming patterns (e.g., kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components)
- Group related files more logically

## 5. Data Layer Modifications

### Changes to Support Read-Only Mode:
- Modified data fetching hooks to work without authentication
- Added mock data support for components that relied on authenticated user data
- Simplified Supabase client configuration to work in public mode
- Removed write operations or made them no-ops with appropriate user feedback

## 6. Next Steps

1. Implement the authentication removal changes ✅
2. Remove external dependencies and routing
3. Clean up unused packages
4. Implement the new folder structure (pending approval) ⏳
5. Refactor components to work with the simplified data layer
6. Implement comprehensive testing to ensure everything works in public mode

## 7. Framework Transition Plan

### Offline-First Architecture Strategy
The new folder structure is designed for an offline-capable application using local persistence (IndexedDB or similar), synchronization queues, and conflict resolution to support seamless user workflows whether online or offline.

### Key Components to Develop:
1. **Sync Queue System**: Track changes made while offline for later synchronization
2. **Offline Data Store**: Local persistence layer for accessing data without network
3. **Conflict Resolution Strategy**: Smart merging of offline changes with server data
4. **Online/Offline Detection**: Reliable network status monitoring

### Migration Approach:
1. Start by implementing core offline infrastructure (sync and cache services)
2. Gradually migrate features one domain at a time (projects, measurements, etc.)
3. Build UI components that gracefully handle both online and offline states
4. Implement comprehensive testing for offline scenarios

This framework transition will ensure a more resilient application experience while preparing the codebase for future expansion and maintainability.
