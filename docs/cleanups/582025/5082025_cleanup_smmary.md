# Window Tracker Application Cleanup Summary - May 8, 2025

## Overview

This document outlines the cleanup and refactoring implemented for converting the Window Tracker application into a public, read-only version with no authentication requirements. The goal was to remove all authentication logic, external dependencies, and prepare the codebase for a framework switch with offline-first capabilities.

## 1. Authentication Removal

### Files Deleted:
- `/src/contexts/auth/` (except for the modified `AuthProvider.tsx` which now provides a public user context)
- `/src/components/auth/`
- `/src/features/auth/`
- `/src/hooks/useLogout.ts`
- `/src/components/modals/LoginModal.tsx`
- `/src/components/modals/SignupModal.tsx`
- `/src/stores/useAuthModalStore.ts` (if not referenced elsewhere)
- `/supabase/functions/backfill-profiles/` (authentication-related)

### Code Modifications:
- Removed authentication checks and conditionals in components
- Modified `AuthProvider.tsx` to provide a public user context
- Simplified hooks like `useFormSubmission.ts` and `useMeasurementUpdate.ts` to work without auth

## 2. External Dependencies & Routing

### External References Removed:
- URLs pointing to external domains in navigation links
- External API calls not required for public read-only functionality
- Embedded content from external sources

### Routing Simplification:
- Removed authentication-protected routes
- Eliminated redirects to login/signup pages
- Simplified navigation to focus on core public features

## 3. New Offline-First Architecture

### Core Services Implemented:
- `offlineStore.ts`: IndexedDB-based local storage system for offline data
- `syncQueue.ts`: Queue system for operations that need to be synchronized when online
- `networkStatus.ts`: Network detection with reliable online/offline status tracking

### New React Hooks:
- `useOnlineStatus`: For detecting and responding to online/offline status changes
- `useOfflineCache`: For interacting with the offline cache
- `useSyncQueue`: For adding operations to the sync queue and processing them when online

### Features Refactored:
- **Projects**: Now supports offline mode with local caching and sync queue
  - `api.ts`: Added offline support for CRUD operations
  - `hooks.ts`: Added hooks for managing projects with offline support

- **Settings**: Now uses offline cache as primary storage
  - `api.ts`: Updated to use IndexedDB with localStorage fallback
  - `hooks.ts`: Added hooks for settings management

- **Activity**: Now works offline with local tracking and sync
  - `api.ts`: Added offline support for activity tracking
  - `utils.ts`: Added utilities for transforming activity data
  - `hooks.ts`: Added hooks for activity feed

## 4. Folder Structure Reorganization

### New Structure Implementation:
```
src/
├── features/           # Business logic by domain
│   ├── projects/       # Projects feature
│   │   ├── api.ts      # Data access functions
│   │   ├── hooks.ts    # React hooks
│   │   ├── types.ts    # TypeScript type definitions
│   │   └── index.ts    # Feature barrel file
│   ├── settings/       # Settings feature  
│   └── activity/       # Activity tracking feature
├── hooks/              # Generic reusable logic hooks
│   ├── useOnlineStatus.ts     # Network status hook
│   ├── useOfflineCache.ts     # Local storage hook
│   └── useSyncQueue.ts        # Sync queue hook
├── services/           # Cross-feature logic
│   ├── cache/          # IndexedDB storage
│   │   └── offlineStore.ts
│   ├── sync/           # Sync operations
│   │   └── syncQueue.ts
│   └── network/        # Network detection
│       └── networkStatus.ts
```

## 5. Next Steps

1. Continue refactoring remaining features (measurements, teams, etc.)
2. Update UI components to indicate offline/online status
3. Implement sync conflict resolution strategy
4. Add comprehensive testing for offline scenarios
5. Create documentation for new architecture
