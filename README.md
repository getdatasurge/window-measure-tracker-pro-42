# üß† Dynamic Markdown Knowledgebase

This project transforms markdown logs of tracked user actions into a dynamic, scrollable React UI. It syncs directly with Lovable's Knowledge Base and logs prompt-response activity to help build smarter AI-driven apps.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-project
cd your-project
yarn install


# Welcome to your Lovable project

## üìö Project Overview

This application is a dynamic window actions tracking and knowledgebase system that:

- Converts markdown-based user action logs into structured JSON data
- Displays real-time UI for visualizing and searching user actions
- Auto-syncs to Lovable's Knowledge Base for context-aware AI assistance
- Logs AI prompts and responses for auditability and improvement

At its core, this system transforms chronological user actions recorded in markdown format into an intelligent knowledgebase that enhances AI interactions by providing relevant context.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Development Setup

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

### Running the Markdown Server

For local development with live markdown syncing, run:

```sh
# Start the markdown server (in a separate terminal)
npm run dev:markdown-server

# Then start the normal dev server (if not already running)
npm run dev
```

### Generating Production JSON

Before deploying to production, generate the actions JSON file:

```sh
npm run generate-actions-json
# or the alias
npm run build:kb
```

### Debug Tools

To verify knowledgebase integrity:

```sh
npm run debug:kb
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000/__debug` while running the dev server to access the full debug UI with live file watchers, parsing previews, and test tools.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `npm run debug:kb` | Validates knowledgebase integrity by checking markdown format, JSON sync status, and log file health |
| `npm run generate-actions-json` | Builds the window actions JSON file from markdown source for production use |
| `npm run build:kb` | Alias for `generate-actions-json` |
| `npm run dev:markdown-server` | Runs a local server for saving markdown files with Git integration during development |
| `npm run kb:ci` | CI-friendly wrapper for debug:kb that ensures proper exit codes for CI environments |

## üß™ Pre-Commit & CI

This project includes automated validation for the knowledgebase:

- **Pre-commit Hook**: Prevents commits if the knowledgebase is malformed, out of sync, or logging files are unwritable.
- **CI Workflow**: Automatically validates the knowledgebase on GitHub for pushes and pull requests to main.
- **Script Aliases**: Use `npm run kb:ci` to manually validate the knowledgebase.

After installation, set up the pre-commit hooks by running:

```sh
node scripts/setup-husky.js
```

This will ensure your knowledgebase stays reliable and properly synced.

## üß† Lovable Sync

The knowledgebase integration with Lovable works as follows:

1. User actions are recorded in `public/window-tracker-prd.md` in a structured format
2. The parser converts these entries into categorized actions with metadata
3. Relevant actions are injected into AI conversations as context when matching the topic

Example of a recorded action:
```markdown
# Navigation Actions
- User clicked on dashboard link [2023-05-01 14:32:15]
- User opened settings menu [2023-05-01 14:33:22]
```

What Lovable might inject as context:
```
User previously navigated to Dashboard (2023-05-01 14:32:15)
User has shown interest in Settings features (2023-05-01 14:33:22)
```

## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS

## Window Actions Viewer

This project includes a window actions viewer that parses markdown files containing user action records and displays them in a structured, interactive UI.

### Local Development with Live Syncing

During development mode:
1. The app will automatically watch for changes to the `public/window-tracker-prd.md` file.
2. When changes are detected, the UI will update in real-time without reloading the page.
3. You can also upload markdown files via the built-in uploader (development mode only).

### Development Markdown Server

To enable saving markdown files during development:

```sh
# Start the markdown server (in a separate terminal)
npm run dev:markdown-server

# Then start the normal dev server
npm run dev
```

This allows you to:
1. Upload markdown files via the UI
2. Save changes directly to disk
3. Test parsing and viewing functionality end-to-end
4. Automatically commit changes to Git for version tracking

The markdown server only runs in development mode and only accepts requests from localhost.

### Collaborative Features

The development server provides Git integration for tracking changes:
- Each save creates a Git commit with timestamp
- View recent commit history for the markdown file
- Changes are tracked for auditability and rollback

### Building for Production

Before deploying, generate the static JSON file from your markdown using:

```sh
# Generate actions JSON from markdown file
npm run generate-actions-json
# or
npx tsx scripts/generate-actions-json.ts
```

This will parse `public/window-tracker-prd.md` and output to `public/data/window-actions.json`.

In production, the app will load actions directly from the pre-generated JSON file.
